Backup::Datto

This set of modules is used to gather and manipulate statistics from Datto's XML API.

Originally, the purpose was to feed this data into other monitoring tools and as a result
the methods in Backup::Datto::Collection are geared towards the data that I was trying
to pull.  However, the idea is to add more functionality to future version numbers.

There are several known limitations with this set of modules. Of particular importance is
that the time comparison functions only correctly handle EST time (it actually is that we
don't check time at all and assume EST.  If all of your appliances are in the same
time zone, the comparisons should still be valid).

The other limitation is that we do not currently handle NAS shares correctly.  This is planned
for the next release.

Feel free to send updates, considering how early in development this is.

The public interface will remain in future versions.  Most of the private methods probably will, too
but that is not guaranteed.
